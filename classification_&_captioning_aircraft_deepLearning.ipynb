        "Aircraft damage detection is essential for maintaining the safety and longevity of aircraft. Traditional manual inspection methods are time-consuming and prone to human error. This project aims to automate the classification of aircraft damage into two categories: \"dent\" and \"crack.\" For this, we will utilize feature extraction with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify the damage from aircraft images. Additionally, we will use a pre-trained Transformer model to generate captions and summaries for the images.\n",

        "The goal of this project is to develop an automated model that accurately classifies aircraft damage from images. By the end of the project, we will have trained and evaluated a model that utilizes feature extraction from VGG16 for damage classification. This model will be applicable in real-world damage detection within the aviation industry. Furthermore, the project will showcase how we can use a Transformer-based model to caption and summarize images, providing a detailed description of the damage."
